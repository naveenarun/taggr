## Taggr: Intelligent Tagging for OSX using Deep Learning
Taggr uses Microsoft Cognitive Services to tag your photos. It uses Python with Python-requests and Tkinter. Native OSX commands such as qlmanage are necessary for image manipulation.
### Installation
Run `source install.sh`. Some packages may require a password.
### Running Taggr on Python 2
Use the command `python taggr.py` to start Taggr. A selected directory must contain images to be analyzed.
### Running Taggr on Python 3
The instructions are the same as for Python 2, but run `python taggr3.py`.
